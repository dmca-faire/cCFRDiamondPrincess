<h2>Aim</h2>

<p>To estimate the infection and case fatality ratio of COVID-19, using data from passengers of the Diamond Princess cruise ship while correcting for delays between confirmation-and-death, and age-structure of the population.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Adjusting for delay from confirmation-to-death, we estimated case and infection fatality ratios (IFR, CFR) for COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess ship as 1.2% (0.38–2.7%) and 2.3% (0.75%–5.3%). Comparing deaths onboard with expected deaths based on naive CFR estimates using China data, we estimate IFR and CFR in China to be 0.5% (95% CI: 0.2–1.2%) and 1.1% (95% CI: 0.3–2.4%) respectively.</p>

<h2>Main text</h2>

<p>In real-time, estimates of the case fatality ratio (CFR) and infection fatality ratio (IFR) can be biased upwards by under-reporting of cases and downwards by failure to account for the delay from confirmation-to-death. Collecting detailed epidemiological information from a closed population such as the quarantined Diamond Princess can produce a more comprehensive description of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases and their subsequent outcomes. Using data from the Diamond Princess, and adjusting for delay from confirmation-to-outcome and age-structure of the ship’s occupants, we estimated the IFR and CFR for the outbreak in China.
As of 3rd March 2020, there have been 92,809 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with 3,164 deaths [1]. On 1st February 2020, a patient tested positive for COVID-19 in Hong Kong; they disembarked from the Diamond Princess cruise ship on the 25th January [2,3]. This patient had onset of symptoms on the 19th January, one day before boarding the ship [2]. Upon returning to Yokohama, Japan, on February 3rd, the ship was held in quarantine, during which testing was performed in order to measure COVID-19 infections among the 3,711 passengers and crew members onboard.
Passengers were initially to be held in quarantine for 14 days. However, those that had intense exposure to the confirmed case-patient, such as sharing a cabin, were held in quarantine beyond the initial 14-day window [3]. By 20th February, there were 634 confirmed cases onboard (17%), with 328 of these asymptomatic (asymptomatic cases were either self-assessed or tested positive before symptom onset) [3].  Overall 3,063 PCR tests were performed among passengers and crew members. Testing started among the elderly passengers, descending by age [3]. For details on the testing procedure, see [2] and [3].</p>

<h2>Adjusting for outcome delay in CFR estimates</h2>

<p>During an outbreak, the so-called naive CFR (nCFR), i.e. the ratio of reported deaths date to reported cases to date, will underestimate the true CFR because the outcome (recovery or death) is not known for all cases [4]. We can therefore estimate the true denominator for the CFR (i.e. the number of cases with known outcomes) by accounting for the delay from confirmation-to-death [5]. 
We assumed the delay from confirmation-to-death followed the same distribution as estimated hospitalisation-to-death, based on data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, between the 17th December 2019 and the 22th January 2020, accounting right-censoring in the data as a result of as-yet-unknown disease outcomes (Figure 1, panels A and B) [6]. As a sensitivity analysis, we also consider raw “non-truncated” distributions, which do not account for censoring; the raw and truncated distributions have a mean of 8.6 days and 13 days respectively.<br/>
To correct the CFR, we use the case and death incidence data to estimate the number of cases with known outcomes [5]:</p>

<p>(see rmd/diamond_princess_cfr_estimates for the LaTeX equation)</p>

<p>where ct is the daily case incidence at time, t, ft is the proportion of cases with delay between onset or hospitalisation and death. u represents the underestimation of the known outcomes [5] and is used to scale the value of the cumulative number of cases in the denominator in the calculation of the cCFR. Finally, we used the measured proportions of asymptomatic to symptomatic cases on the Diamond Princess to scale the corrected CFR (cCFR) to estimate the infection fatality ratio (IFR).</p>

<h2>Corrected IFR and CFR estimates</h2>

<p>We estimated that the all-age cIFR on the Diamond Princess was 1.2% (0.38–2.7%) and the cCFR was 2.3% (0.75–5.3%) (Table 1). Using the age distribution of cases and deaths on the ship [2,3], we estimated that for individuals aged 70 and over, the cIFR was 9.0% (3.8–17%) and the cCFR was 18% (7.3–33%) (Table 1).  The 95% confidence intervals were calculated with an exact binomial test with death count and either cases or known outcomes (depending on whether it was an interval for the naive or corrected estimate).</p>

<p>Using the age-stratified nCFR estimates reported in a large study in China [7], we then calculated the expected number of deaths of people who were onboard the ship in each age group, assuming this nCFR estimate was accurate. This produced a total of 15.15 expected deaths, which gives a nCFR estimate of 5% (15.15/301) for Diamond Princess (Table 2), which falls within the top end of our 95% CI. As our corrected cCFR for Diamond Princess was 2.3% (0.75% - 5.3%), this suggests we need to multiply the nCFR estimates in China [7] by a factor 46% (95% CI: 15–105%) to obtain the correct value. As the raw overall nCFR reported in the China data was 2.3% [7], this suggests the cCFR in China during that period was 1.1% (95% CI: 0.3-2.4%) and the IFR was 0.5% (95% CI: 0.2-1.2%). Based on cases and deaths reported in China up to 4th March 2020, nCFR = 2984/80422*100 = 3.71% (95% CI 3.58% - 3.84%); this naive value is significantly higher than the corrected CFR we estimate here.</p>

<p>The case fatality ratio is challenging to accurately estimate in real time [8], especially for an infection with attributes similar to SARS-CoV-2, which has a delay of almost two weeks between confirmation and death, strong effects of age-dependence and comorbidities on mortality risk, and likely under-reporting of cases in many settings [6]. Using an age-stratified adjustment, we accounted for changes in known outcomes over time. By applying the method to Diamond Princess data, we focus on a setting that is likely to have lower reporting error because large numbers were tested and the test has high sensitivity.</p>

<p>The average age onboard the ship was 58, so our estimates of cCFR cannot directly be applied to a younger population; we therefore scaled our estimates to obtain values for a population equivalent to those in the early China outbreak. There were some limitations to our analysis. Cruise ship passengers may have a different health status to the general population of their home countries, due to health requirements to embark on a multi-week holiday, or differences related to socio-economic status or comborbities. Deaths only occurred in individuals 70 years or older, so we were not able to generate age-specific cCFRs; the fatality risk may also be influenced by differences in healthcare between countries. Because of likely age-specific differences in reporting, we focused on overall cCFR in China, rather than calculating age-specific cCFRs [7].</p>

<!--- ## Aim 

To estimate the case fatality ratio (CFR) of COVID-19, using data from the Diamond Princess cruise ship and correcting for delays between confirmation-and-death.

## Abstract

We calculate the case and infection fatality ratios for the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) onboard the quarantined Japanese cruise ship the Diamond Princess. By comparing observed deaths on the Diamond Princess to the number of deaths expected using the CFR estimate for the COVID-19 outbreak in China, we estimate that the Chinese CFR estimate is inflated by 46% due to under-reporting and present adjusted severity estimates for the cruise ship data based on this.

## Main body

As of 3rd March, there have been 92,809 confirmed cases and 3,164 of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [@WHOsitrep]. The disease has spread to 64 different countries in every continent except Antartica and the WHO risk assessment is now at “Very High” for China, the Regional level, and the Global level [@WHOsitrep].

On 1st February it emerged that a patient testing positive for COVID-19 in Hong Kong had recently disembarked from the cruise ship “Diamond Princess” on the 25th January and had experienced symptoms (a cough) since the 19th January, a day before boarding the Diamond Princess [@DiamondPrincessFieldBriefing1]. Upon returning to Yokohama, Japan on February 3rd the Diamond Princess was held in quarantine while testing was performed to assess the scale of COVID-19 transmission onboard.

Passengers were initially to be held in quarantine for 14 days, but passengers that were judged to have had further COVID-19 exposure, such as sharing a cabin with a confirmed case, were held in quarantine past the initial 14-day window. By February 20th, there were 634 confirmed cases onboard, with 328 of these being asymptomatic, overall 3,063 PCR tests were performed, primarily in elderly ‘high-risk’ groups [@DiamondPrincessFieldBriefing2].

Collecting such detailed epidemiological information from a captive population allows for less biased estimates of the proportions of symptomatic cases and overall cases that result in death, referred to as the case fatality ratio (CFR) and infection fatality ratio (IFR) respectively. The intensive testing carried out on the Diamond Princess lowers the probability that asymptomatic or subclinical cases go undetected. Trying to estimate the IFR from reported cases can significantly overestimate the IFR since cases without symptoms will not report and will go uncounted.

### Corrected IFR and CFR estimates

Typically, what is known as the naive CFR (nCFR) - which is simply the ratio of deaths and cases - is reported to assess the fatality rate of an infectious disease. However, we statistically need to correct for the delay between diagonsis of the disease and outcome of the patient (recovery or death) if this is to be accurately calculated during an ongoing epidemic [@kucharski2014case]. Case fatality ratios (CFR) must be corrected to account for infections that are currently confirmed but are yet to result in recovery or death yet [@nishiura2009early]. Including such cases in the CFR calculation without adjustment results in underestimation of the true CFR value [@kucharski2014case].

We use distributions for the time from hospitalisation-to-death, estimated from the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China in @linton2020incubation. The hospitalisation-to-death distributions have a mean of 14.5 days and 20.2 days for the non-truncated and truncated versions respectively. The truncated distribution attempts to account for right-censoring in the outbreak data due to unknown disease outcomes (Figure 1, panels A and B) @linton2020incubation. We then use the known proportions of asymptomatic to symptomatic cases to scale the cCFR to estimate the infection fatality ratio (IFR).

To correct the CFR, we use the case and death incidence data in the following equation from @nishiura2009early, given by

where  is the daily case incidence at time is a sample from the delay distribution between onset or hospitalisation and death.  represents the underestimation of the known outcomes [@nishiura2009early] and is used as the denominator in the overall calculation of the corrected CFR (cCFR) instead of raw case numbers. This typically leads to an increase between the nCFR and the cCFR, as it predicts the outcome of a number of the current cases within the calculation. 

We estimate that the cCFR and the cIFR for COVID-19 are 1.2% (0.38% - 2.7%) and 2.3% (0.75% - 5.3%) respectively (Table 1). 

| Age Range | cIFR | cCFR | Distribution |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| All ages combined | 0.91% (0.11% - 4.3%) | 1.9% (0.60% - 4.3%) | hospitalisation-to-death non-truncated (Figure 2A) |
|        |1.2% (0.38% - 2.7%) | 2.3% (0.75% - 5.3%) | hospitalisation-to-death truncated (Figure 2B) |
| 70-89  | 0.91% (0.11% - 4.3%) | 1.9% (0.60% - 4.3%) | hospitalisation-to-death non-truncated (Figure 2A) |
|        |1.2% (0.38% - 2.7%) | 2.3% (0.75% - 5.3%) | hospitalisation-to-death truncated (Figure 2B) |


*Table 1: Corrected IFR and CFR estimates calculated using the reported case and death data on the Diamond Princess cruise ship [@DiamondPrincessFieldBriefing1]. Correction was performed using equation (1) and the distribution used within this correction was the hospitalisation-to-death distribution given in [@linton2020incubation]. There are another 25 cases, but we did not include them as their data was not present in [@DiamondPrincessFieldBriefing2] and no age stratification or symptomatic/asymptomatic data was available for them.*

The accuracy of this correction can be tested once an epidemic is over, as cases are resolved and the nCFR converges to the true CFR. The cCFR was shown to be much more accurate than the nCFR during the 2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak, where it correctly predicted a CFR of around 71% rather than the nCFR estimates of 50% [@kucharski2014case].

| Age Range | symptomatic | asymptomatic | Proportion | nCFR | Expected deaths using nCFR | Observed deaths on cruise ship |

*Table 2: \ageStratAsymptomatic Age stratified data of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases on-board the Diamond Princess [@DiamondPrincessFieldBriefing1], [@DiamondPrincessFieldBriefing2], along with the naive CFR estimates given by the China CDC [@wu2020characteristics] and the expected number of cases in each age group if the nCFR estimates were correct where the total number of expected deaths under these estimates was 15.15.*


Using the Chinese CDC age stratified CFR estimates [@wu2020characteristics], we calculate the expected number of deaths on-board the Diamond Princess within each age group. This results in a total of 15.15 expected deaths, which gives a CFR estimate (15.15/301) = 5% (Table 2). Given that our corrected CFR estimates are 2.3%, we arrive at an scaling of 46% between the two estimates.

<!--- Using this scaling, we are then able to adjust the China CDC age stratified severity estimates. Doing so results in the following proportion estimates: symptomatic cases that were severe is 6.9% (2.2% - 15.8%), symptomatic cases that were critical is 2.3% (0.8% - 5.3%), total hospitalisation is 9.1% (3.0% - 21.1%), the adjusted overall CFR is 1.1% (0.3% - 2.4%) and the adjusted overall IFR is 0.5% (0.2% - 1.2%). The confidence intervals are calculated by scaling the 95% confidence intervals given in the corrected CFR and IFR estimates. We then apply these severity estimates to the age stratified case data on the cruise ship, giving the results shown in Table 3.

*Table 3: \adjustedData Age stratified data of different severity levels of cases on-board the Diamond Princess [@DiamondPrincessFieldBriefing1], [@DiamondPrincessFieldBriefing2], estimated by adjusting the China CDC severity estimates (ref) by rescaling their estimaes by the difference in our two CFR estimates.* 

Our adjustments to the Diamond Princess age stratified figures make some assumptions. Firstly, they assume the effects of the care provided on the Diamond Princess are similar to that of the care provided in China. This is clearly a limitation of our method, but to the extent that the care on the Diamond Princess lowered the case of severe symptoms is unknown, as patients had very little medical attention during their mandatory quarantine, given a postive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 [@DiamondPrincessFieldBriefing2]. However, even though the severity estimates are crude, they are a significant improvement on the naive calculations routinely dissemintated during an epidemic, in which the biases and statistical errors have been shown to be significant when the outbreak in question has ended [@kucharski2014case]. --->
